<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated M.Tech in Software Engineering from VIT Vellore</li>
  <li>Class XII from The Velammal International School</li>
  <li>Class X from Vidya Peetam Senior Secondary School</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Programming languages: Python, Java, C/C++, HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>Core Subjects: Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, Digital Logics and Microprocessors, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence</li>
  <li>Tools & Automation: GitHub, Adobe XD, Figma, Canva, Valgrind, Visual Studio Code, Google Colab, Java Swing, Python Flask, ARM CMSIS and HAL libs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Billing System</h3></li>
<p>We developed an ERP-style billing system using Java, incorporating Maven for dependency management and Swing/Flatlaf for a contemporary user interface. Designed MySQL entities and their relationships. </p>
<li><h3>Speech Detection on Embedded Hardware</h3></li>
<p>In this project, I trained a TensorFlow Lite speech recognition model to operate within 320 KB of RAM on an Arm Cortex M7. Utilized CMSIS HAL, DSP, and NN libraries with C and C++ for implementation. The model recognizes speech commands to control a bulb on/off as a PoC. Used Valgrind for profiling and optimization.</p>
<li><h3>ECG Signal Prediction and Anomaly Detection</h3></li>
<p>We explored the effectiveness of two prominent architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) + Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ConvLSTM in predicting ECG signal and detecting anomaly in the signal. By comparing the performance of these models, we aimed to determine the most effective approach for prediction and detection.</p>
